                            The Lawn Mower Rights Movement began when founder,
                            Kushal Vanavasam, observed the cruel and inhumane
                            treatment of lawn mowers. Along with his friends,
                            they have formed together to stop this insanity that
                            we <i>homo sapiens</i> have imbellished upon this
                            species. Help support our cause for the rights of
                            these intelligent beings.

                            the most active role in this important movement,
